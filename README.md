# Adaptive PID Controller For Propeller Arm Positioning
The project is a design of best-performing adaptive PID controller for a propeller arm angle positioning system. 

The system is powered by a servo motor connected to a propeller. Then, the propeller is connected to a joint via a considerably long stick. The power given to the motor as the input of the system is controlled by a controller system based on Arduino UNO board. As a result, there exists a rotation in propeller which creates the torque that moves the stick arm. In other words, propeller arm is having a speed and an angle change as the outputs of the system.

The whole project and the controller mechanism are created, simulated, and tested using MATLAB Simulink environment. The physical behavior of the system is embedded to a software as a protected block by Prof. Alper Demir who is academician in Ko√ß University Engineering Faculty.
